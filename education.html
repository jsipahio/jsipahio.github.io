                            <h4>M.S. Computer Science, Kent State University - May 2024 (Expected) </h4>

                            Studied topics from a variety of fields in computer science with the goal of having well-rounded knowledge of the field. Topics I studied include data mining, web programming, software engineering, network security, systems programming, computer graphics and rendering, and networks. My thesis is exploring how improvements to the Deep Space Network security protocols can improve the efficiency of the deep space network.  

                            

                            <h4>B.S. Computer Science, Kent State University - May 2024 (Expected)</h4>

                            Interests include cybersecurity and web development. Capstone/thesis explored numerical and machine learning solutions for partial differential equations, specifically the Cahn-Hilliard equation. 

                            <h4>B.A. Mathematics, Kent State University - May 2024 (Expected) </h4>

                            Primary interests include applications of mathematics, including probability, differential equations, and linear algebra. Also knowledgeable in abstract algebra and number theory.
