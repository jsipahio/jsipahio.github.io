                                Composing and Defending Against DDoS Attacks and Prevention Methods on Gaming Servers (In Progress) 
                            </h4>

                            <em>Summary:</em> Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks constantly threaten network servers, with attackers motivated by various factors, ranging from trolling to extortion attempts. These attacks can have severe financial implications for victims, regardless of the attackers' motivations. In recent years, game servers have been particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. In our previous research into how these attacks can be effectively carried out on game servers, we found that attacking the port that the game is available on was most effective. We now look at how these attacks can be detected and prevented, and what methods work best for game servers in specific. Detection methods can be based on machine learning, statistical methods, blockchain, thresholds, or some combination of methods. Many recent methods rely on machine learning, with both unsupervised and supervised models showing some success. Prevention methods focus on filtering the detected malicious traffic out while allowing valid requests to continue to pass through. One way this is done is by presenting a challenge-response sequence that a bot would not be able to respond to, but an actual user would. Here, we aim to provide a framework that is most suitable for protecting game servers from DDoS attacks.

                        <h4>The Application of Data Mining in Social Media Analysis</h4>
                        <h5>Collaborator: Rui Wang</h5> 
                        
                        <em>Summary:</em> This was a  two-part paper, with the first  being a  survey of data  mining techniques in social media. The different applications were presented. Then, the techniques for finding these insights were discussed. Most recent methods rely upon machine learning techniques. A difficulty in these methods, however, is the noisiness of the data. The second part focused on applying the techniques learned in the survey to data that we collected. I attempted to use Steam game reviews as training data that determined what category of game a piece of text was referring to. Even with the reviews being pre-classified based on what game they were for it was difficult to build a training set that produced accurate results due to the quality of the training data still being low, and the fact that many games fall into multiple categories.

                        <em>Summary:</em> The  Cahn-Hilliard  (CH)  equation  is  a  fourth-order partial  differential  equation originally proposed to model alloy decomposition. Since then, it has been applied to many other fields, including other material science applications, fluid-flows, simulating tumor growth, and image processing. Due to the high order and  complexity of the CH equation, numerical  methods to approximate are difficult  to develop. Physics informed neural networks use the boundary and initial conditions of a PDE to inform its loss function, allowing for the
