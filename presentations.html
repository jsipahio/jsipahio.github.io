                            Will present research on prevention methods for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Methods are often a tradeoff between efficacy and service impact; methods that work close to the attack target are more effective at identifying attacks but can still result in performance degradation. The opposite is true for methods that work farther from the target. 

                            

                            <h4>Ohio Space Grant Consortium Research Symposium, Cleveland, Ohio (March 2024) </h4>

                            Will present alternatives to the IPSec based security used currently to secure communications for the deep space network (DSN). Newer VPN technologies such as WireGuard can offer the security of IPSec with lower overhead, which could improve the transmission efficiency of the DSN.

                            Presented research on quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Quantum computers use quantum bits (shortened to qubits) to perform calculations. Due to quantum entanglement, it is possible for quantum computers to perform operations that are not possible on normal computers. This does not mean they are faster, but it does mean they can perform algorithms that are more efficient and cannot be performed on quantum computers. Thus, the methods by which quantum computing can defeat current cryptographic methods were presented, along with future methods that could leverage quantum computing to create secure communication channels. One principle of quantum computing is that the state of the bits changes each time they are read, which allows for probability-based algorithms to be implemented for security.

                            A meta-analysis of how artificial intelligence impacts, and will impact, daily life was presented. Much of what was found in that research has come true, or even exceeded expectations, with AI becoming pervasive in the everyday life of many individuals. A toy example of how machine learning can be used for resume filtering was created and analyzed. The example was highly limited due to the inability to collect sufficient training data, but it provided an outline and demonstration for how artificial intelligence is used in the screening process for job candidates.
