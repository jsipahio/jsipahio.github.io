                                Tutor, Kent State University  
                            </h4>

                                Tutored students in mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and physics at multiple levels.  
                                Tutoring has been very informative in learning what aspects of math and computer science students struggle with and has developed a better understanding of how to explain those topics. This also influences my teaching style as I have learned which topics need to be explained more in- depth, allowing me to structure courses accordingly. Having been a tutor has provided me with the perspectives of a variety of students and taught me to adapt to many different learning styles. It has also motivated me to seek ways to integrate a Growth Mind-Set approach to student learning.

                            </h4>

                                Assisted class of ninth grade students in use of Scratch and mBlock programming during the 13th Annual International Conference for Intelligent Human Computer Interface (IHCI) at Kent State University. This experience taught me how even a very high level "language" like Scratch is able to introduce programming to individuals who have little to no experience. It was also a great example of how outreach can be done, even at a large, international conference.
