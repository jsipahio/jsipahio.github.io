# CSE122 
This is mostly setup help for students who cannot, or do not wish to, use Visual Studio. Students on Mac (or Linux or Windows) can follow these instructions to install the .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, and create and run .NET console apps from the command line.  
- [Setup](setup.md) - This provides instructions to install .NET and VS Code, and test that they are working.
- [.NET Commands](dotnet_commands.md) - This provides instructions for how to create your labs and open them in VS Code.
- [Terminal Basics](terminal_basics.md) - This provides instructions for navigating a terminal shell, if you would like to get more familiar with that. This one is mostly optional, but may be helpful if you get stuck with something in the terminal, or just want to learn more.
