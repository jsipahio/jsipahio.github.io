                            <p>
                                I am currently a student at Kent State University finishing a Master's of Science and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics.
                                Currently I am working as a tutor for math and computer science. I also work as an IT coop at PCC Airfoils where I do web development using Microsoft .NET Core Blazor.
                                I would like to teach computer science courses at a university upon finishing my degrees, and am currently looking for opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am knowledgeable in many programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, Rust, and Visual Basic. I have
                                also well versed with using Linux. I primarily have done research with network security, but have also studied machine learning
                                and numerical computing. Currently I am researching DDoS attacks, as well as studying the potential performance improvements that could be
                                made by switching from IPSec to WireGuard in the Deep Space Network.
